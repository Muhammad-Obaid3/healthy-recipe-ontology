## 📘 Project Overview

This project is part of my **MSc in Computer Science & Technology** at **Ulster University, UK**. It focuses on applying **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning** (KRR) to solve a real-world challenge: providing smart, health-focused recipe recommendations.

Rather than using a simple filtering system, this project leverages **ontologies**, **semantic relationships**, and **DL Queries** to infer suitable recipes for users with conditions like diabetes, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), or seasonal preferences.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 **Personalized Recipe Reasoning** using Description Logic (DL) queries
- 🧩 Ontology built in **Protégé** using **OWL 2.0**
- 🍎 Semantic links between:
  - Recipes
  - Ingredients & Nutrients
  - Dietary Restrictions
  - Cooking Methods
  - Meal Types & Cuisines
- ⚖️ Logical constructs: `equivalence`, `restrictions`, `transitive` and `symmetric` properties

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

This ontology-based system can be applied across multiple domains that require intelligent, personalized food and health recommendations:

### 🍽️ Smart Meal Planning Apps  
> Suggest personalized recipes based on health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease), dietary preferences, or nutrient goals.

### 🏥 Clinical Decision Support  
> Help dietitians and healthcare providers recommend suitable meals for patients with specific medical or nutritional needs.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Wellness Chatbots  
> Integrate into chatbots to answer questions like “What can I eat with high blood pressure?” or “Suggest a vegan, high-protein dinner.”

### 📱 Nutrition-Focused Mobile Apps  
> Enable mobile health apps to go beyond filters by using semantic reasoning to tailor recommendations intelligently.

### 🧑‍🍳 Dynamic Restaurant Menus  
> Restaurants can offer curated menus for customers with allergies, food intolerances, or lifestyle preferences (e.g., keto, vegan, gluten-free).

### 🧠 Semantic AI Agents  
> Power intelligent agents that reason over food, health, and diet-related knowledge using ontologies and DL logic instead of flat databases.
